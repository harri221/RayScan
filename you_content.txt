You're asking a very important question — how to replicate and build upon prior work in a way that’s novel, publishable, and impactful. Let’s break it down:

🧠 Which Paper(s) Are You Replicating?
Your proposed pipeline builds on two foundational papers:

✅ 1. “Ultrasound renal stone diagnosis based on CNN and VGG16 features”

Core Method:


Feature extraction via VGG16


Classification via XGBoost


Dataset: ~600 ultrasound images


Reported Accuracy: ~99.47%


✅ 2. “Automated Detection of Kidney Stones in Ultrasound Images” – Gurjeet Kaur et al.

Core Method:


Traditional image filtering


CNN classifier trained end-to-end


Dataset: ~9,416 images (similar to yours)


Reported Accuracy: ~99.1%


🔬 What You’re Doing Differently (Your Novel Contribution)
To publish your research, you must either:

Use a better dataset, or


Use a better model, or


Add new techniques, or


Solve a new real-world challenge.

You're doing all four. Here’s how:

🔧 Novel Improvements You’re Making (for Publication)

🧪 Suggested Section Title for Your Future Paper
"Real-Time Kidney Stone Detection Using Enhanced CNN-XGBoost Hybrid and High-Resolution Ultrasound Dataset for Mobile Diagnostic Integration"

✍️ Paper Structure When You Publish

📌 Final Verdict
Yes — you're not just replicating prior work; you're:

Scaling it up with a better dataset


Making it deployable


Improving preprocessing and classifier combinations


Adding explainability


Creating real-world impact via mobile integration

👉 This is a publishable upgrade. Just make sure you document everything — especially comparisons and visualizations.

Would you like me to now generate:

A GitHub-ready implementation plan for this?


A Jupyter Notebook template that starts with preprocessing + bilateral/CLAHE filters?


A research paper outline for your future publication?

Let’s take the next step.
